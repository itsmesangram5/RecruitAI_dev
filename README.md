# Project Setup and Database Management

## Setting Up the Virtual Environment

To set up your development environment, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   - On Windows:

     ```sh
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS/Linux:

     ```sh
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Flask Application**

   ```sh
   flask run
   ```

## Database Setup

1. **Create the Database**

   Execute the following SQL command to create your database:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE `my_database` /*!40100 DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci */ /*!80016 DEFAULT ENCRYPTION='N' */;
   ```

2. **Initialize Database Migrations**

   If migration files are not already present, initialize the migration setup:

   ```sh
   flask db init
   ```

3. **Create Migration Files**

   Generate migration scripts for your database schema changes:

   ```sh
   flask db migrate -m "Commit Message"
   ```

4. **Apply Database Changes**

   Apply the migrations to your database to create/update the schema:

   ```sh
   flask db upgrade
   ```

## Summary

By following these instructions, you'll have a virtual environment set up, dependencies installed, a Flask application running, and a database configured with the necessary tables and migrations. This will provide a robust foundation for developing and managing your project.

For any further details or advanced configurations, refer to the official Flask documentation and your specific project requirements.
